# SloFurs Events Website

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/e87dc0cd44694747b3a5fa19ac5286ae)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/Pur3Bolt/SloFurs?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=Pur3Bolt/SloFurs&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This is a website tailored for creating and managing events, more specifically aimed at the furry community. Users create an account, fill out their details and then register for events they wish to attend. This makes it easier for the user as they don't need to submit their personal info every time they want to attend an event. The administration is tier-based, meaning some users get more privileges than others and as such can edit or view more.
The site is created and tailored to the specific needs of SloFurs, but the goal is to make it as adaptable to different needs, so that it can be widely used by other, non-Slovenian, furry communities.
