  <h1>Rules of Conduct for SloFurs events and Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>The events are held with the intention to create a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere for furries and their guests, who decide to attend. We try to avoid as many formalities and written rules as possible, depending on our attendees' common sense. Nonetheless, we have noticed a need to prepare and publish these basic rules in order to avoid unnecessary complications regarding organization, attendee conduct or law abidance. As these rules are merely an outline, they contain guidelines for certain expected situations, in all other cases the first three general rules apply. Most of the time, common sense will help you decide what is acceptable and what not. If in doubt, ask a member of the organization team.</p>
  <p>All versions of these Rules of conduct are publicly available <a href="https://slofurs.org/pravila/">here</a>, with the lastest version being available on this page. For the duration of an event, the most recent version of the Rules of conduct, available at the beginning of the event, apply.</p>
  <p>Web sales on this website (events.slofurs.org) are managed by društvo SloFurs (SloFurs organisation), Gregorčičeva ulica 33, 5000 Nova Gorica, Slovenia, identification number: XXXXXXXXXX, tax number: XXXXXXXXXX, which is the provider of the services (referred also as the seller).</p>

  <h3>General rules</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>All members of the organization team and organizational sub-teams (referred to as the organizer, who is writing this text in first person) reserve the right to alter these Rules of conduct at any given time without prior announcement. Furthermore, they reserve the right to full interpretation of these Rules of conduct, and in rare instances, their adaptation. The Rules of conduct are not debatable during events. In situations, not covered by these Rules of conduct, only the organizer has full authority and power to bring decisions. The organizer can reject any members registration without explanation. Decisions made by the organizer are final.</li>
    <li>Any actions which interfere with the planned course of organization of an event, contradicts the event's purpose, causes direct discomfort, in any way endangers or harms any attendees, the venue, the surroundings of the event or the public near the event will result in immediate demand to leave the event. During the event the valid legislation of the Republic of Slovenia applies, any transgressions against the law will be immediately reported to the authorities. Furthermore, rules set by the manager of the venue, at which the event is held, also apply. Personal disagreements, which do not concern all attendees will not be regarded by the organizer unless if they lead to violation of the Rules of conduct.</li>
    <li>Everyone is responsible for their own actions, even when under influence of alcohol or other substances. The organizer is not liable for any injury or damage suffered by an attendee during an event. All attendees agree that their membership may be revoked at any time (the attendee will be demanded to leave the event), without reimbursment of costs, in case of violation of the Rules of conduct.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Registration and attendance</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Attendees need to be at least 18 years old on the first day of the event.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>On some events an exception can be made and minors, who are at least 15 years old on the first day of the event, may attend the event during a set time period. This exception only applies to events for which it has been clearly stated to apply in the official announcement for the event, published by the organizer, along with a set time period.</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Only a registered person with a confirmed registration (referred to as member) may attend a SloFurs event, unless stated otherwise.</li>
    <li>Prior to registration, you need to specify accurate personal information which include, but are not limited to your name and surname, date of birth and address of residency. In case of doubt, the organizer will request to see a valid personal identification document, issued by the country of residence. Inaccurate information will lead to membership revocation and a potential ban from future events.</li>
    <li>A registration may only be confirmed by the organizer. Registrations made by banned individuals will be immediately rejected. If cost payment is required before an event, registration will only be confirmed once full payment has been completed. Registered attendees, which do not attend the event, are not eligible for a refund, unless a different agreement has been reached between the attendee and the organizer prior to registration. In case of membership revocation due to Rules of conduct violation, the attendee is not eligible for any kind of refund.</li>

  </ol>

  <h4>Payment methods</h4>
  <p>If attendance to an event requires cost payment, we allow you to pay the following ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>payment through bank transfer,</li>
    <li>credit or debit card using the Stripe system,</li>
    <li>on the spot with cash.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Which payment methods will be available to you depend by the organisers decision. All payments are final and binding, as explained in the <b>complaints and refunds</b> section.</p>

  <h3 id="transfer">Transferability of tickets</h3>
  <p>In the case that you can't attend an event for which you have already purchased a ticket for, you may transfer it to another person. In this case, please email us with your wish and let us know the email address of the user you're transferring the ticket to. The user must already have a confirmed registration for the same event, otherwise we won't be able to transfer the ticket.</p>
  <p>Tickets can't be transferred between different events.</p>

  <h3 id="refunds">Complaints and refunds</h3>
  <p>In accordance to Slovenian law, the consumer is not entitled to withdraw from the contract for leisure services in which the contractor undertakes to fulfill his obligation at a specific date or within a specified time limit. This means that all purchases are binding and final no matter how you completed the purchase (in person or online). In other words; you cannot return any purchased tickets for any event no mater where it's being held and demand a refund for them.</p>
  <p>In the case that an event is cancelled or has its date or location changed, the seller is responsible for handling the situation and for handling refunds. Upon the occurrence of these circumstances, the seller will inform ticket buyers as soon as possible regarding refund options. If the buyer does not request a refund within 14 days of these changes being made public, he/she agrees with the aforementioned changes and after that period he/she is again not entitled to a refund.</p>
  <p>In the event of a refund, ticket holders will receive a refund, without any further request, in the same way they paid the tickets. This invalidates the ticket.</p>
  <p>Minimal or justified changes to the event are reserved, eg. shifting the start of the event for a few hours of altering the programme of the event. In the event of cancellation, change of the date or location of the event or change in the program, any additional costs you may incur (eg. travel, hotel, delivery, payment, etc.) will not be reimbursed.</p>
  <p>The seller does his best to ensure that all prices on the website are accurate, but errors can still occur. If the seller detects a mistake in the ticket price already purchased by the buyer, the seller will inform the buyer as soon as possible and give the buyer the opportunity to re-confirm the order at the right price or cancel it. Should the seller fail to contact the buyer, the buyer agrees to treat the seller's ticket as canceled. If the buyer chooses to cancel the ticket at the wrong price after his payment has already been made, the seller will refund him the money.</p>
  <p>Complaints are resolved by the ticket buyer and the seller within the complaint period, which is eight days from the receipt of the written complaint by the complainant. Within this period, the seller is obliged to provide the complainant with a written or oral response to the submitted complaint.</p>
