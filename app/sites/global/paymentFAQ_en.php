  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions about advance payments</h1>
  <p class="lead">Did you come across an event, where SloFurs expects advance payments? We gathered a few questions and answers you might have.</p>

  <h3>Why is it necessary to pay in advance?</h3>
  <p>You are probably used to paying for the event in person on the spot from our past meets. As a result, event organizers are financially constrained by what activities, food and drinks they can prepare for the event. In addition, the organizers take the risk of unforeseen and unannounced cancellations, even though the costs have already been paid for. Since we only wish the best for our SloFurs events, we concluded that we need to collect payments for certain events in advance.</p>

  <h3>What does this mean for me?</h3>
  <p>These changes will not impact participants in any negative way, but it does let us improve our events. This way we can afford, e.g. renting event venues, better anticipate the amounts we can spend on food and drinks, as well as purchase items for fun activities. Because of these changes, we have updated <a href="<?php echo URL;?>rules" target="_blank">our Terms of Service</a> accordingly. This is to protect us as the seller and you as the buyer. We recommend you to read the terms and contact us if you have questions.</p>
  <p>By paying in advance we're also letting you know of the exact cost for the event. In case we collect payments in person, we still reserve the right to give a price estimate and decide on the final price at the start of the event.</p>

  <h3>How can I pay?</h3>
  <p>Payment is possible in two ways: you can transfer the due amount to our bank account (the details are mentioned in the ToS and on events which require payments in advance) or you can pay online using your debit or credit card via Stripe. If using the latter option, you will be redirected to the payment processor website where you will safely complete your payment. After paying you will be redirected back to our page.</p>
  <p>We only enable you to pay after your registration is confirmed by us. You can initiate payments through the same page where you registered for the event.</p>

  <h5>What's Stripe?</h5>
  <p>In case you haven't heard of Stripe before, this is a payment processor, similar to PayPal. They enable safe processing of online payments using your credit or debit card. If you're a user of Google Pay or Apple Pay, you can also use those methods of payment. Stripe is a globally known company which is also used by bigger companies (such as Humble Indie Bundle or Kickstarter), so rest assured that your payments are secure.</p>

  <h3>When is the due date for payment?</h3>
  <p>Due dates can vary from event to event, from a few days to a few months after you registered for the event. The due date can also be the same for everyone, no matter when you registered. Because of these variances, we inform you of the payment due date on the registration form. If your due date is missed and payment isn't received, we'll unfortunately have to cancel your registration.</p>

  <h3>I've paid for the event, but can't make it. What can I do?</h3>
  <p>In case you can't attend an event for any reason, you're unfortunately not subject to a refund, you can however transfer your admission to another person. You can read more on this <a href="<?php echo URL;?>rules#transfer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

  <h3>Unexpected changes were made to the event. Can I demand a refund?</h3>
  <p>Although we try not to make major changes to our events, it may sometimes be necessary to make some changes. In some cases, you are entitled to a refund, if you do not agree to the changes.</p>
  <p>If there are minimal or justifiable changes to the performance of the event, e.g. an activity has been added or removed, or the start of the event is delayed by a few hours within the same day, <b>you are not</b> entitled to a refund.</p>
  <p>If we change the location or date of the event, <b>you are</b> entitled to a refund within the time limit specified in the Terms of Service. If this is the case, please contact us so we can arrange the refund.</p>
  <p>More on this is explained in <a href="<?php echo URL;?>rules#refunds" target="_blank">our ToS</a>.</p>
